    <h3>What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?</h3>
    <div>==></div>
    <p>null represents a deliberate non-value or empty object reference, while undefined represents an uninitialized or
        missing value.</p>
    <pre>
        let number = null 
        let number; <code>//undefined</code>
    </pre>
    <hr />

    <h3>
        What is the difference between a function declaration and a function expression in JavaScript?
    </h3>
    <div>==></div>
    <p>
        A function declaration creates a named function that is hoisted to the top of its scope, while a function
        expression creates an unnamed function that is assigned to a variable or property.
    </p>
    <pre>
        function add(a,b){
            return a+b
        } <code>//function declaration</code>

        const add = function(a,b){
            return a+b
        } <code>//function expression</code>
    </pre>
    <hr />

    <h3>
        What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code execution in JavaScript?
    </h3>
    <div>==></div>
    <p>
        Synchronous code is executed in a sequential order, blocking the program until a task is completed, while
        asynchronous code allows multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously and continues running without waiting for
        a task to complete.
    </p>
    <pre>
        function add(a,b){
            return a+b
        }
        add() <code>//Synchronous</code>

        setTimeout(()=>{
            console.log("hello")
        },2000) <code>//Asynchronous</code>
    </pre>
    <hr />


    <h3>What is the purpose of the “this” keyword in JavaScript?</h3>
    <div>==></div>
    <p>
        The “this” keyword refers to the current object context and allows methods to access and manipulate properties
        and methods of the object that called them.
    </p>
    <pre>
        class CAR {
            constructor(type){
                this.type = type
            }

            getType(){
                return this.type <code>//refere current object</code>
            }
        }

        let honda = new CAR("petrol")
        honda.geType()
    </pre>
    <hr />


    <h3>What is the difference between “var”, “let”, and “const” in JavaScript?</h3>
    <div>==></div>
    <p>
        “var” declares a variable with function scope, “let” declares a variable with block scope, and “const” declares
        a variable that cannot be reassigned.
    </p>
    <pre>
        let fname ="ram"
        var lname = "patil"
        const ADSRESS = "india"
    </pre>
    <hr />


    <h3>What is a closure in JavaScript?</h3>
    <div>==></div>
    <p>
        A closure is a function that has access to variables in its outer lexical scope, even after the outer function
        has returned.
        <br /><br />
        A closure is a function that has access to variables in its outer (enclosing) function’s scope. This allows the
        function to “remember” the values of those variables, even if they are no longer in scope.

    </p>
    <pre>
         const outer =()=>{
                 let outercount = 1;
                 const inner = ()=>{
                     console.log("inner", outercount)
                 }
                 return inner
         }
         const fun = outer()
         fun() <code>//inner 1</code>
    </pre>
    <hr />


    <h3>What is the difference between a for loop, foreach, for..of, and a for…in loop in JavaScript?</h3>
    <div>==></div>
    <p>
        A for loop iterates over a range of values, for…in loop iterates over the properties of an object
        for…of and foreach loop iterates over the Array
    </p>
    <pre>
        let arr = [1, 2, 3]
        let obj = {name: "avinash", address: "pune"}
        <hr/>
        for(let i = 0; i <= 2; i++){
            console.log(arr[i])  <code>//1,2,3</code>
        }
        <hr/>
        for(let i in obj){
            console.log(obj[i]) <code>i is a key and output will be "avinash"</code>
        }
        <hr/>
        for(let i of arr){
            console.log(i) <code>//1,2,3</code>
        }
        <hr/>
        arr.foreach((i)=>console.log(i)) <code>//1,2,3</code>
    </pre>
    <hr />


    <h3>What is the difference between a while loop and a do while loop in JavaScript?</h3>
    <div>==></div>
    <p>
        While loop checks the condition before executing the statement(s), do-while loop executes the statement(s) at
        least once before checking the condition
    </p>
    <pre>
        while(condition){
            statement
        }
    <hr/>
        do{
            statement
        } while(condition)
    </pre>
    <hr />


    <h3>What is hoisting in JavaScript?
    </h3>
    <div>==></div>
    <p>
        Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their
        scope, allowing them to be used before they are declared.
    </p>
    <pre>

        console.log(count) <code>//variable hoisting</code>
        add(1,3)  <code>//function hoisting</code>

        var count = 2 

        function add(a,b){
            return a+b
        }

    </pre>
    <hr />

    <h3>How can you check if a variable is an array in JavaScript?
    </h3>
    <div>==></div>
    <p>
        You can use the Array.isArray() method to check if a variable is an array. It returns true if the variable is an
        array, and false otherwise.
    </p>
    <pre>
       const arr = [1,2,3]
       console.log(Array.isArray(arr)) <code>//true</code>
    </pre>
    <hr />

    <h3>What is an immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE) in JavaScript?</h3>
    <div>==></div>
    <p>An IIFE is a function that is immediately executed when it is defined. It is typically used to create a private
        scope and avoid polluting the global namespace. For example:
    </p>
    <pre>
        (function() {

            // code goes here
          
          })();
    </pre>
    <hr />


    <h3>What are the primitive data types in JavaScript?</h3>
    <div>==></div>
    <p>
        The primitive data types in JavaScript are string, number, boolean, null, undefined, and symbol (added in ES6).
    </p>
    <hr />

    <h3>What is the difference between the “==” and “===” operators in JavaScript?</h3>
    <div>==></div>
    <p>
        The “==” operator compares two values for equality, converting them to a common type if necessary, while the
        “===” operator compares two values for strict equality, without type coercion.
        <br /><br />
        == is a loose equality operator that compares values without considering their data types. === is a strict
        equality operator that compares values while considering their data types. For example, “1” == 1 would return
        true, while “1” === 1 would return false.
        <br /><br />
        == compares values for equality after converting them to a common type, while === compares values for equality
        without type conversion.
    </p>
    <pre>
        console.log(22=="22") <code>//true</code>
        console.log(22==="22") <code>//false</code>
    </pre>
    <hr />

    <h3>What is the difference between let and var in terms of hoisting?</h3>
    <div>==></div>
    <p>Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope, meaning that they can be accessed before they
        are declared. Variables declared with let are not hoisted, and attempting to access them before they are
        declared will result in a reference error.
    </p>
    <pre>
     console.log(a) <code>//undefined</code>
     console.log(b) <code>//reference error</code>
     var a = 10
     let b = 20
    </pre>
    <hr />

    <h3>What is a callback function</h3>
    <div>==></div>
    <p>
        A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is called when that
        function completes
    </p>
    <pre>
        const print = (i) => console.log(i)

        const fun = (a,b,callback) = >{
            callback(a+b)
        }

        fun(10,20, print)

    </pre>
    <hr />

    <h3>What is a variable in JavaScript?</h3>
    <div>==></div>
    <p>
        A variable is a named storage location in JavaScript that holds a value. It is used to store data that can be
        accessed and manipulated throughout a script.
    </p>
    <pre>
        const PI = 3.14

        const areaOfCircle = (r) => PI*r*r

        areaOfCircle(10)
    </pre>
    <hr />

    <h3>How do you declare a variable in JavaScript?
    </h3>
    <div>==></div>
    <p>You can declare a variable in JavaScript using the “var”, “let”, or “const” keyword followed by the variable
        name. For example:
    </p>
    <pre>
        var myVariable;

        let myVariable;
        
        const myVariable;        
    </pre>
    <hr />

    <h3>What is a function in JavaScript?</h3>
    <div>==></div>
    <p>A function is a block of code that performs a specific task in JavaScript. It can be reused multiple times
        throughout a script and can accept input parameters and return values.
    </p>
    <hr />

    <h3>What is an array in JavaScript?</h3>
    <div>==></div>
    <p>
        An array is a collection of data in JavaScript that can hold multiple values, including strings, numbers, and
        objects. It is declared using square brackets and each value is separated by a comma
    </p>
    <pre>
        let myArray = [“apple”, “banana”, “orange”];
    </pre>
    <hr />

    <h3>What is an object in JavaScript?</h3>
    <div>==></div>
    <p>
        An object is a collection of properties in JavaScript that can hold multiple values, including strings, numbers,
        arrays, and other objects. It is declared using curly braces and each property is separated by a comma. For
        example:
    </p>
    <pre>
        let myObject = {

            name: “John”,
          
            age: 30,
          
            hobbies: [“reading”, “traveling”]
          
          };
    </pre>
    <hr />

    <h3>How do you create a new object in JavaScript?
    </h3>
    <div>==></div>
    <p>You can create a new object in JavaScript using either object literal notation (const obj = {}) or the Object()
        constructor (const obj = new Object()).
    </p>
    <hr />

    <h3>What is the purpose of the map() method in JavaScript?
    </h3>
    <div>==></div>
    <p> The map() method is used to create a new array by applying a function to each element of an existing array. The
        original array is not modified.
    </p>
    <pre>
        const  arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
        const sqr = arr.map(i=>i*i) <code>//1,4,9,16,25,36</code>
    </pre>
    <hr />

    <h3>What is a promise in JavaScript?
    </h3>
    <div>==></div>
    <p>A promise is an object that represents a value that may not be available yet but will be in the future. It allows
        you to write asynchronous code that is more readable and maintainable.
    </p>
    <hr />

    <h3>How do you write a conditional statement in JavaScript?</h3>
    <div>==></div>
    <p>
        You can write a conditional statement in JavaScript using the if, else if, and else keywords and also we can use
        switch. For example:
    </p>
    <pre>
        if (x > 10) {

            console.log(“x is greater than 10”);
          
          } else if (x < 10) {
          
            console.log(“x is less than 10”);
          
          } else {
          
            console.log(“x is equal to 10”);
          
          }
        <hr/>
        switch(expression) {
            case x:
              // code block
              break;
            case y:
              // code block
              break;
            default:
              // code block
          }
    </pre>
    <hr />

    <h3>How do you check if an object has a specific property in JavaScript?
    </h3>
    <div>==></div>
    <p>You can check if an object has a specific property in JavaScript using the “in” operator or the hasOwnProperty()
        method. For example:
    </p>
    <pre>
        “propertyName” in myObject; // true or false

        myObject.hasOwnProperty(“propertyName”); // true or false
                
    </pre>
    <hr />

    <h3>How do you convert a string to a number in JavaScript?
    </h3>
    <div>==></div>
    <p>You can convert a string to a number in JavaScript using the Number() or parseInt() functions. For example:
    </p>
    <pre>
        Number(“123”); // 123

        parseInt(“123”); // 123
